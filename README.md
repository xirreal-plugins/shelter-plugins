## About this template

Feel free to edit **anything** in this template to your needs. This is more of a suggestion of what's possible and an easy way to deploy simple Cumcord plugins. To get started making Cumcord plugins, have a look at the [official documentation](https://docs.cumcord.com/).

Everything you need is located in the [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file. You should go and edit it.

### Hosting

This template is meant to work with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). By default it's setup on a custom domain to demonstrate the possibility but you should just use the default \[username\].github.io domain by [editing the actions file](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

> **DISCLAIMER:** Using a free domain service like freenom **can** result in your userbase getting hacked. Don't be stupid, use the default \[username\].github.io domain or a domain you paid for from a reputable domain registrar.
