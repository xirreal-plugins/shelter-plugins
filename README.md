# Shelter plugins

This repo contains my [shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter/) plugins.

# How to install?

Paste the URL below into the add plugins modal in shelter. As shrimple as that.
If you wanna get even fancier, use the one click installers. (ok technically _two_ clicks because you need to confirm installation)

> Mind the trailing `/`! It's still part of the URL, don't forget it.
